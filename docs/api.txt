Targets (objects in the sky)
    
    Create or update a target with a given ID
    
    post /targets/:id               
    {target: {ra: 3, dec:4, target_name:"Crab" }}  can include other meta data 
    

    get /targets
        returns a json list of target ids with their names 
    
    get /targets/2
        returns the json of the current target with id 2 if it exists
        
    post /current_target/:id
        {beam: {beam_no: 1}}
        sets the current target that the telescope is looking at with beam no 1
    
    get /current_target/
        returns the current list of targets in each beam 
        
Followups (requests for follow up)
    get '/followups' 
        returns a list of the currently pending followups
    
Status 
    get '/status'
        returns the current status of the telescope (currently can be active/inactive/followingUp)

    post '/status/:state'
        {status:'active'}
        {status:'inactive'}
        {status:'followingUp', :targets=>[{followUpId: 20}, {folowUpId:23}]}
        sets the current status of the telescope we can include other status is needed

Subjects 
    post '/subjects/:id'
        Multipost with file and 
        {activity_id: 1, target_id :2, observation_id :3 }
    
    get '/subjects'
        returns a list of all active subjects
    
    get '/subjects/:id'
        get the subject with a specific id
        
    
        
Flow of work from Franks point of view 

    1) Telescope starts working and Frank receives a post to /status?status=active
    2) Telescope starts observing a new target with id 3, Frank receives a post to /targets/ with the new target info and a post to /current_target to update the current target 
    3) Frank starts receiving data to post /subjects which represents new data
    4) While this is happening charlie keeps polling /followups for potential followups
    5) Marv starts picking up data form the cache and pushing it out to users he marks a followup request
    6) a request form /followups yields a result, this is passed through the seti system and a decision is made to follow up or not 
    7) a follow up is triggered. Frank receives a post to /status?status=followingup&followup_id=2323
    8) frank continues to accept data including the follow up observations
    9) frank receives a post to /status?status=active to inform him the telescope has gone back to normal operations
