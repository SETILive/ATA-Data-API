        returns a json list of target ids with their names 
    
    get /targets/?id=2
        returns the json of the current target with id 3

        sets the current target that the telescope is looking at 
    
    get /current_target/
        returns the current target 
        
Followups (requests for follow up)

Status 
    get '/status'

        {status:'active'}
        {status:'active', followup_id : 23}
        sets the current status of the telescope

Flow of work from Franks point of view 

    1) Telescope starts working and Frank receives a post to /status?status=active
    2) Telescope starts observing a new target with id 3, Frank receives a post to /targets/ with the new target info and a post to /current_target to update the current target 
    3) Frank starts receiving data to post /subjects which represents new data
    4) While this is happening charlie keeps polling /followups for potential followups
    5) Marv starts picking up data form the cache and pushing it out to users he marks a followup request
    6) a request form /followups yields a result, this is passed through the seti system and a decision is made to follow up or not 
    7) a follow up is triggered. Frank receives a post to /status?status=followingup&followup_id=2323
    8) frank continues to accept data including the follow up observations
    9) frank receives a post to /status?status=active to inform him the telescope has gone back to normal operations
